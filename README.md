# Personal Blog

This is a basic web development project by a beginner. I will be using HTML, CSS, and the Python Flask framework to create a basic blog.
It contains a landing page, an about page, and the blog page itself. Since the blog is meant to cover a variety of topic, readers
will be able to filter the posts by topic according to their interests.

The HTML files can be found in the **templates** folder. 
The CSS files can be found in the **static** folder.

The folder structure of the project will be updated further.
